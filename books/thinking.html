        <p>Thinking classrooms require intentionality, strong design, and a commitment to changing instructional practice (Gini-Newman & Case, 2018, p. 135). These actions are led by the teacher and supported by pedagogical decisions which promote learning partnerships with students. Thinking is not a one-way process. We can design our courses to encouarge and expect student thinking at all levels and in all tasks. The authors clearly define the problem and suggest solutions based on evidence and intentional actions by teachers to drive meaningful changes in practice.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="grid__content--full">
        <p>Thinking doesn't happen on accident. Habits and mindsets can be fostered which lead to active thinking experiences for students. As teachers work toward building classes which foster thinking skills, intentioality is a critical component. If we don't intend for our students to think about their learning, then they won't.</p>
        <p>Many teachers complain that their students don't think about what they're doing in class (including myself at times). We fail to define what we want students to think <em>about</em> in these situations. Developing situations in which students think actively is an instructional decision and is not contingent on student effort alone. As students are exposed to situation in which thinking serves a strong, defined purpose, the depth of work will expand. In other words, if we intend for students to think about their work, we are capable of defining those parameters ourselves.</p>
        <p>Most strategies in <em>Thinking Classrooms</em> do not require a complete rewrite of our curriculum. In fact, the Gini-Newman and Case (2018) argue that we are far too quick to rewrite our instruction rather than revise our ideas (p. 20). If an activity doesn't spur the intended thinking processes, it does not need to be thrown out completely. It should be analyzed for strengths and weaknesses and revised for later. Stepping back and looking at the actual outcomes in light of the expected outcomes can give fresh perspective on how to adapt and improve.</p>

        <p>If we intend to improve our students' thinking skills, we have to see them as partners in the learning process rather than subjects of schooling (p. 35). This is a subtle mental shift, but when made, it recategorizes students as co-learners with the teacher and opens possibilities for interventions. The blame is shared when an activity doesn't produce thinking: poor design or implementation was met with substandard thinking on the part of the students. Realizing that we are prompting our students to engage is a difficult schema adjustment for teachers. Practically, this can be achieved by working toward consistent feedback of learning progress rather than evaluative reports of knowledge retention (Gini-Newman & Case, 2018, pp. 89, 217). Grades often become barriers because the student's cognitive energies are spent on the score, not on the learning at hand and their thinking suffers as a result. Lowering the barrier for engaging in critical work by removing grades as a feedback mechanism alleviates this pressure and allows the student to work more effectively.</p>

        <p>Paralleling <em><a href="/books/deep-learning.html">Deep Learning</a></em>, the culture of change in a building will strengthen or diminish the capacity for change. Building a culture of thinking with students sets the expectation that thinking will occur. Gini-Newman and Case (2018) identify four principles of successfully implementing an initative (p. 65):</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Shape climate</li>
          <li>Build capacity</li>
          <li>Create opportunity</li>
          <li>Provide guidance</li>
        </ol>
        <p>In the bigger picture of systems change, thinking classrooms will not change the culture of a building without a commitment to change from the entire faculty (Gini-Newman & Case, 2018, p. 35). The same structure is paralleled in the individual classes as content is explored. The teacher <b>shapes the climate</b> of thinking through strong instruction. To practically build a culture of thinking, teachers need to consider what they are asking of students in their instruction. Gini-Newman & Case (2018) ask readers to consider a continuum of engagement (p. 149). Does our instruction encouarge (and ultimately, expect) true engagement in learning? Or have we fallen into a habit of doing work for the sake of working (Gini-Newman & Case, 2018, p. 111)? Thinking classrooms expect students to engage with the problem and learning, not the paperwork. Pushing for deeper engagement through strong design can help build a culture for and capacity to think deeply.</p>
        <p>A thinking framework encourages students to find relationships in material. Building meaning from facts allows students to "inquire into an aspect of an issue or topic, and therefore, thinking critically, creatively, and collaboratively becomes the way students learn", (Gini-Newman & Case, 2018, p. 170). Inviting questions about the topic instead of feeding questions to answer shifts the impetus for engagement to the student and allows for choice with constraint. Thinking skills are reinforced through exploration which emerges organically as students and teachers learn together.</p>
        <p>Practical supports are given all throughout the book. Fundamentally, all design decisions by the teacher support or erode the principle of thinking about learning. It is easy to underestimate the value of <em>purpose</em> in the classroom. As teachers, we alredy know the big picture. We can see connections in material because we have the fully-formed schema from which to draw. <em>Thinking Classrooms</em> reinforces this idea in the foundation: background knowledge is critical for moving students into a position of critical thinking. With this in mind, any task or activity given in a thinking classroom has to have explicit, direct purpose to solving the problem. When the work, regardless of form, has direct applicative value, students are more likely to engage in thought and go beyond minimum requirements (Gini-Newman & Case, 2018, p. 149).</p>
